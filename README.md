# How to Use
Save the script as Kaito.py
Make it executable: chmod +x Kaito.py
Run against a target: python3 Kaito.py http://example.com

## Ethical Considerations
Only use against systems you have permission to test
Responsible disclosure is important
Some vulnerabilities might trigger false positives

## Ethical Hacking Techniques
Error Analysis: Look for verbose error messages
Path Traversal: Check for directory traversal vulnerabilities
Authentication Bypass: Test login bypasses
Input Validation: Check for injection vulnerabilities

## Responsible Usage
Always use responsibly and ethically
Document all activities thoroughly
Follow responsible disclosure guidelines

## Ethical Hacking Tools
Burp Suite: For intercepting and modifying requests
Nikto/Nmap: For web crawling and port scanning
SQLmap: For database exploitation

## Ethical Hacking Best Practices
Test incrementally: Start with basic checks before moving to complex ones
Use minimal payloads: Avoid payloads that might crash the application
Document everything: Record all activities and findings

## Ethical Hacking Workflow
Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target
Vulnerability Assessment: Identify potential vulnerabilities
Exploitation: Test vulnerabilities responsibly
Reporting: Document and report findings accurately
